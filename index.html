                        Whitney Houston, who ruled the pop charts during the 1980s and '90s, will be laid to rest Saturday
                        following a funeral at her childhood church in Newark, New Jersey.
                    <h2>A look back at key moments in Houston's life, as well as her last days:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>August 9, 1963</strong></li>
                        Houston is born in Newark to gospel singer Cissy Houston.
                        <li><strong>1983</strong></li>
                        Arista Records' Clive Davis is taken to a New York nightclub to see Houston perform; he signs her on the
                        spot.
                        <li><strong>March 1985</strong></li>
                        Houston's debut album, "Whitney Houston" is released.
                        <li><strong>June 1987</strong></li>
                        Houston's second album, "Whitney," is released and entered the Billboard album charts at No. 1,
                        according to Houston's website.
                        <li><strong>November 1990</strong></li>
                        Houston's third album, "I'm Your Baby Tonight," is released, selling some 8 million copies worldwide.
                        <li><strong>January 27, 1991</strong></li>
                        Houston sings "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl XXV before a record 79 million viewers.
                        <li><strong>July 18, 1992</strong></li>
                        Houston marries R&B singer Bobby Brown.
                        <li><strong>November 1992</strong></li>
                        Houston appears with Kevin Costner in "The Bodyguard." The film's soundtrack, featuring Houston's smash
                        hit -- a remake of the Dolly Parton single "I Will Always Love You" -- went 17-times platinum, making it
                        the biggest-selling motion picture soundtrack album in history. "I Will Always Love You" becomes the
                        biggest-selling commercial single in history.
                        <li><strong>March 4, 1993</strong></li>
                        Houston gives birth to her daughter with Brown, Bobbi Kristina Brown.
                        <li><strong>1998</strong></li>
                        Houston releases "My Love Is Your Love," which earns her a Grammy but does not match the performance of
                        her previous albums, according to Biography.com.
                        <li><strong>Late 1990s and early 2000s</strong></li>
                        Reports about Houston's struggles with drug addiction, health problems and her rocky marriage with Brown
                        begin to surface. Album sales drop off, and her voice begins to show signs of wear.
                        <li><strong>2002</strong></li>
                        In a now-infamous interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Houston admitted to using drugs but denied using
                        crack. "Crack is wack," she said, quoting a line from a mural painted in 1986. In the same interview,
                        Houston told Sawyer, "The biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy."
                        <li><strong>2004</strong></li>
                        Filming begins on the short-lived reality show "Being Bobby Brown," featuring Brown and Houston, which
                        aired in 2005. "The show aired during the worst years of the couple's crumbling marriage: drug use,
                        lifestyle excess and bad behavior were all caught on tape, and Houston's reputation sunk to new lows,"
                        according to Biography.com. Houston later said she did the show to try to save her marriage.
                        At some point, Houston's mother, Cissy Houston, steps in. Houston told Oprah Winfrey in a 2009 interview
                        that her mother arrived on her doorstep with sheriff's officers and a court order for drug intervention.
                        "She walks in with the sheriff and she says: 'I have a court injunction here. You do it my way or we're
                        not going to do this at all,'" Houston recalled in the interview. "'You're going to go on TV and you're
                        going to retire. And say you're going to give this up because it's not worth it.'"
                        Houston enters rehab and takes a long hiatus.
                        <li><strong>2006</strong></li>
                        Houston and Brown separate. They divorce the following year, and Houston receives sole custody of Bobbi
                        Kristina.
                        <li><strong>2009</strong></li>
                        Houston releases "I Look To You," her first album in seven years.
                        <li><strong>2011-12</strong></li>
                        Houston works to turn her career around with the movie "Sparkle," the remake of a 1976 film said to be
                        loosely inspired by the Supremes. The movie is set for release this summer.
                        <li><strong>February 7, 2012</strong></li>
                        Houston visits Dr. Shawn Nasseri, a Beverly Hills ear, nose and throat specialist, according to a source
                        familiar with her visit.
                        <strong>February 8 and 9</strong>
                        Houston is seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at the Beverly Hilton hotel
                        before 10 a.m., according to a source briefed on her behavior and activity in the days before her death.
                        Guests on both days overhear Houston complaining loudly about her drinks, accusing bartenders of
                        "watering down" or "putting too much ice" in them, the source said. Guests express concern about
                        Houston's erratic behavior, according to the source; her disheveled appearance, including mismatched
                        clothing, suggested to them that she was intoxicated. Houston is seen jumping in and out of the pool and
                        doing somersaults in the pool area, the source said.
                        <li><strong>February 9</strong></li>
                        Houston attends a pre-Grammys party to celebrate singer Kelly Price's nominations. At one point, she
                        joins Price on the stage and sings a hoarse rendition of "Jesus Loves Me." (Price said Monday that
                        Houston was not behaving erratically and "I didn't see someone who was high" although she said Houston
                        did drink champagne. Photos of Houston leaving the party appeared to show her sweaty and somewhat
                        disheveled, although Price attributed her "messy" appearance to partygoers' singing and dancing until
                        the wee hours of Friday morning.)
                        <li><strong>February 10</strong></li>
                        Investigators are aware of Houston's partying at the hotel and other venues the night before her death,
                        a source close to the death investigation told CNN.
                        <li><strong>February 11</strong></li>
                        Houston is set to attend Clive Davis' pre-Grammys party at the Beverly Hilton. She is seen drinking at
                        the hotel pool in the morning, according to the source briefed on her behavior and activity, but
                        witnesses report she was not behaving erratically.
                        3:43 p.m.
                        Police and fire officials are summoned to Houston's room after she is found unconscious in the room's
                        bathtub.
                        3:55 p.m.
                        Houston is pronounced dead at age 48 after efforts to revive her are unsuccessful.
                        <li><strong>February 12</strong></li>
                        An autopsy is performed on Houston's body. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said a cause of
                        death is undetermined pending the results of toxicology tests.
                        <li><strong>February 13</strong></li>
                        Houston's body is flown back to her native New Jersey.
                        <li><strong>February 15</strong></li>
                        Houston's death certificate is filed in Los Angeles. It lists her cause of death as "deferred," meaning
                        a determination is delayed pending more information.
                        <li><strong>February 16 (investigation update)</strong></li>
                        The anti-anxiety medication Xanax was among prescription drugs found in the room, a source close to the
                        death investigation says. Houston's family members and staff confirmed she used the medication, the
                        source says, but investigators don't know whether she took it the day she died. No Valium or other drugs
                        classified as benzodiazepines, or sedatives, were found in the room, according to the source. Medicine
                        and pill bottles found in Houston's hotel room are currently undergoing basic testing, but nothing so
                        far indicates anything criminal occurred, the source says. Officials are trying to speed up <li>

                        By order of Gov. Chris Christie, flags in New Jersey fly at half-staff.
                        <li><strong>February 18</strong>
                            Family, friends and fellow stars remember Houston's voice, love and -- most of all -- faith at her
                            homegoing service at the New Jersey church in which she grew up. Actor Kevin Costner, singers Stevie
                            Wonder and Alicia Keys, and director-producer Tyler Perry are among those on hand to pay tribute to
                            the pop superstar. During the private, televised service Houston's fans log onto social media
                            worldwide to share their emotions online.</li>
